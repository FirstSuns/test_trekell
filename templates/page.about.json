Never one to let the old gates and their keepers stand in the way of progress, Bridges and her team have worked tirelessly to push art supplies into the future and the hands of the next generation. That tenacious evolution has led to advances in production and sustainability. It has also fostered a new way of thinking, reconfiguring dusty ideals to better suit an increasingly diverse market.
